           <li>Memory games are like exercises for the brain. </li>
           <li>They help people with dementia by giving their brains a fun and challenging workout, which can help slow down the disease.</li>
           <li>When people with dementia play memory games with others, they also get to interact with others and feel less lonely. </li>
           <li>These games can also help improve their memory recall, which is important because people with dementia often have trouble remembering things.  </li>
           <li>Playing memory games can make people with dementia feel good about themselves and proud of what they can still do.</li>
